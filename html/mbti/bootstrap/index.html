    <p class="text-center">
    All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
    Am I the girl that you dream of?
    All those little times you said that I'm your girl
    You make me feel like your whole world
    I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
    Don't come through, babe, you never do
    Because I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    All those special times I spent with you, my love
    They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
    But I don't really mind, I've got my drugs and that
    Like my memories, I don't need that
    I'll wait for you, babe, you don't come through, babe
    You never do, babe, that's just what you do
    Because I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    Don't say you need me when
    You're leaving, you leave again
    I'm stronger than all my men
    Except for you
    Don't say you need me then
    You live last, you're leaving
    I can't do it, I can't do it
    But you do it best
    I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
    I'm pretty when I cry
